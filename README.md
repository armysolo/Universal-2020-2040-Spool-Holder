# Universal-2020-2040-Spool-Holder


I designed this to be universal and to prevent the spool from rocking back and forth during retractions. For hardware you'll need:  

2x F625ZZ Flanged Bearings for each "Spool Holder Step" part.  
2x M5 nuts. 1 goes into the main spool holder base to hold in the M5 screw and the other goes into the knob.  
2x M5 washers. 1 goes in between the bearing in the "Spool Holder Step" part and "Spool Holder Base" and the other in between "Spool Holder Step" and the knob.  
1 long M5 bolt. I used one that was 100mm.  
3x M5 bolts to hold it to the frame.  

Be sure to print 2 "Spool Holder Step"
